## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a Full Stack Python developer...

I started out as a self-taught developer, but moved to Coding Dojo to get more structure with my education. I currently work in the Finance industry as a Trading Specialist at a large Broker-Dealer. 
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a personal project.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning MySQL, Python, Flask, Jinja, Javascript, and so much more. There is always something new to learn. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I train for Spartan Races. I travel over the United States to compete.
